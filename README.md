# ðŸš€Pionia FrameworkðŸš€

The first PHP REST framework that is truly restful.

It runs on top of âœ¨ Moonlight âœ¨ architecture.

## Creating a project

```bash
composer create-project pionia/pionia-app my_simple_project
```
Please remember to replace `my_simple_project` with your project name

## Directory
    
> 1. ðŸ“‚ authenticationBackends:-
       This is where authentication backends should reside. 
> 2. ðŸ“‚ middlewares:- This is where all request middlewares reside
> 3. ðŸ“‚ services:- This is where our actual business logic resides.
> 4. ðŸ“‚ Controller.php:- This is the only controller we need for the entire project.
> 5. ðŸ“„ MainApiSwitch.php:- This is the one that maps requests to their respective services.
> 6. ðŸ“„ routes.php:- This is where our one and only endpoint resides.
> 7. ðŸ“„ index.php:- This is our entry file to our project.
> 8. ðŸ“„ jet:- This is our commandline helper.
> 9. ðŸ“„ settings.ini:- all settings for our entire project reside here.

After installation, just run the following to start the server
```bash
php pionia serve  # http://localhost:8000
```

By default, the server will run on port 8000, to change that, run the following
```bash
php pionia serve -p8080 # http://localhost:8080
```

Your endpoint is now running on http://localhost:8000/api/v1/

## Quick Guide for Getting Started.

You can follow along the documentation but its under active development.

[Go to documentation here](https://pioniaphp-project.github.io/pionia-docs/)

### Creating a service.
Create a new service in services folder. Services are normal PHP classes that extend `Pionia\request\BaseRestService`.

### Creating an action
In the service/class created above, create a method that returns `Pionia\response\BaseResponse`. 
This action/method can take on the following params in the respective order:-
       
1. $data:- This is the request data minus the files.
2. $files:- These are the files that have been sent along.
3. $request:- This is the entire request instance. You can omit this and access it in your actions using `$this->request`.

All requests will also define the action name which is the name of the method you want to run in the service registered.

Example Service with an action.

```php
<?php

namespace application\services;


use Pionia\request\BaseRestService;
use Pionia\response\BaseResponse;

class UserService extends BaseRestService
{
//    public array $actionsRequiringAuth = ['login']; # You can define all actions that will require authentication globally by adding the method names here.
//    public bool $serviceRequiresAuth = true; # Or you can mark that the entire service can only be access by authenticated users.
//    public array $deactivatedActions = ['login'] # you can also mark actions as deactivated by passing them in here.    
    protected function login(
     $data, // this must be the first variable
     $files, // this must be the second
     // $request, You can access the entire request object from here
     ): BaseResponse
    {
//       $this->request; // or you can access it like this.
//       $this->can('VIEW_LOGIN'); // checks if the current user has a permission
//       $this->auth(); // the currently authenticated context user object
//       $this->mustAuthenticate(); // user wont pass here if they are not authenticated
       return BaseResponse::JsonResponse(0,
        "This is the sample response message to the frontend",
         [$data,$files]);
    }
}
```

### Check authentication context.
In your action/method, check for methods like `$this->mustAuthenticate($optionalMessagehere), $this->auth()`.
You can find all the available [methods here ](https://Pionia-project.github.io/Pionia-Core/classes/Pionia-request-BaseRestService.html)

### Registering services
In the `MainApiSwitch.php` add your service and give it a name, example:-
```php
# ... rest of the switcher

public function registerServices(): array
    {
        return [
            'user' => new UserService(),
        ];
    }
```
From there on, all requests targeting the `UserService()` will pass the key `SERVICE` with value `user`.

## Request
All requests must define two keys that is `SERVICE` and `ACTION`.

Example request:-
```json
{
    "SERVICE" :"user",
    "ACTION": "login"
    // ...rest of the data also as key-value
}
```

Also, formData is supported as below:- 

```js
let data = new FormData();
data.append('SERVICE', 'user');
data.append('ACTION', 'login');
// more data can be appended to data here
```

## Response
All requests have the same response as [explained here](https://Pionia-project.github.io/Pionia-Core/classes/Pionia-response-BaseResponse.html).

All actions in services must return `BaseReponse` from `Pionia\response\BaseResponse` which is composed of the following:-

1. `$returnCode`:- Return Code is the new and custom way of returning your own custom codes back to the frontend.
The fact that you can customize these gives your team a chance to define different codes for dirrent scenarios.
> However, `returnCode of 0` is reserved for successful requests for conventional purposes but you can make this whatever you want.

> This is the only required parameter on the response. implying that every response defines this atleast.

2. `$returnMessage`:- This is the message you want to send to the front-end or nothing.
3. `$returnData`:- This can be an anything, from arrays, to objects, to anything that you want to sent to the front-end
4. `$extraData`:- Any other data you want to send back to the front-end, can also be anything or nothing.

To send a response, just call:- 
```php
use Pionia\response\BaseResponse
// rest of your method login here
return BaseResponse::JsonResponse(0, $message, $data, $extraData);
}
```

The format of the response, controller, switch, and request is what defines the architecture `Moonlight`.

## Database Querying
This framework is meant for performance intensive applications. Both developer and program performance. 
That's why it strips off the use of models and maintains simple queries that we are all used to. 

No more hustling with customization, it's your query, you know what to do with it.

With that in mind, we provide you some helpers that ease this work:- 

Using the class `QueryBuilder()`, you have access to and three methods:-

 >  one($query, array $bindings):- 
This method is for when you want to return a single item.
```php

$username = $data['email'];
$query = new \Pionia\database\QueryBuilder();

$results = $query->one("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :username", ['username'=>$username]); // an object

```

> all($query, $bindings):- This is for returning an array of items

```php
 $query = new QueryBuilder();
 $results = $query->all("SELECT * FROM users"); // array of items
```

> Query($query, $mode):- This is helpful for running queries directly that are unbound. It can run all sorts of queries.

```php

 $query = new \Pionia\database\QueryBuilder();
 $query->Query("INSERT into password_reset_tokens(email, token) values ('sample@gmail.com', 12345)");
```

### Multi-databases
By default, the database under the `[db]` setting in the settings.ini will be used.

You can however, define other databases like `[db2]` and use them like this.

```php

$q = new QueryBuilder\();
$q->Using('db2')->all('your-query-here-as-usual');
```

Note that, `Using` must be called first to change the connection before calling the other instance methods.

So, from the above, we get the following cons

 - No mapping result sets to models therefore no model hydration.
 - No strange ORM therefore you get to do what you want.
 - No migrations, no more commands to run. 
 - You get to customise and optimise your queries according to you!!
 - You get to work with any existing or new databases!

### Query Pagination

We understand that you might be wanting to query huge datasets, we got that covered.

```php


$paginator = new \Pionia\database\Paginator("select * from users");

$results = $paginator
            ->LimitBy(10) // items per page
            ->startFrom(0) // where to start from 
            ->paginate(array $bidings_if_any); // call this to finally run the pagination along any of your bindings
```

The response will be an associative array containing the following :-
       
* total_records :- These are all the the records before applying the limits and offsets
* results :- This is the data we got back from the database.
* next_offset :- Next starting point basing on current limit and offset.
* previous_offset :- Offset to call if one wants to go back.
* has_next_page :- If we have a next page to go to at all. False if we are at the last page.
* has_prev_page :- If we can go back. False if we are at the first page 
* number_of_records :- The number of records returned in the current result set. Should always be less than limit.

## Middlewares

A middle in this framework run on every request and every response. 
It runs before before authentication backends. Therefore, you can't access the authenticated user context from the request, but the cleanup will 
have this data, therefore you can access the authenticated user. This is great for doing staff like logging a request, encrypting and descryption...

All middleware must extend `Pionia\core\interceptions\BaseMiddleware`

```php

class MySimpleMiddleware extends \Pionia\core\interceptions\BaseMiddleware
{
    public function run(\Pionia\request\Request $request,?\Pionia\response\Response $response){
        if ($response){
            // here you can do logic that has access to both request and response
            // this will run after running the service. So there is a high chance that you can even access the response data here
        } else {
            // add login here that only has access to request only.
            // this will run the first time before hitting the actual service
        }
    }
}
```

### Middleware Registration

Creating a middleware is not enough, you need to add them in our `kernel`.
Head over to `index.php` and add it on this line
```php
->registerMiddleware([
    'application\middlewares\MySimpleMiddleware'
])
```
That's it, your middleware is now ready to start running against every request and every response.

## Authentication Backends.

These are the strategies the app will use to authenticate user to the app context.
They run on every request in the order of their registration.

Once one of these set the user to context, the rest will be ignored!

Imagine an app where users authenticate differently forexample for web and mobile.
This could be your advantage to define them seperately. You can also have only auth backend, example
all your users can decide to authenticate using JWT. That's it. Implement that and you're done.

All Auth Backends must extend the `application\core\interceptions\BaseAuthenticationBackend`, implement the 
`authenticate` method and return `ContextUserObject` or `null`

That means in your backend, the only job you have is to query and set up the `ContextUserObject` accordingly.
```php
class MobileAuthBackend extends BaseAuthenticationBackend
{

    public function authenticate(Request $request): ContextUserObject
    {
        // this is where you can look up your user accordingly and set up
        return new ContextUserObject();
    }
}
```
Authentication Backends also have access to the ongoing request just incase you want to pick something from headers or body itself.

### Authentication Backend Registration.

Just like middlewares, you can find and add your auth backends to the `kernel` in `index.php` on this line

```php
->registerAuthBackends(['application\authenticationBackends\MobileAuthBackend']) // add your authentication backends here
```

And that's it!!!
